# 💫 About Me:
Hi! I’m Mohamed — Computer Science student focused on Machine Learning & NLP.<br>I build data-driven solutions and machine learning projects that solve real problems, especially in natural language processing. I’m learning modern ML tooling like Python, scikit-learn, and data pipelines, and I’m always pushing code that shows progress, not just ideas.<br><br>I’m currently looking for junior/entry opportunities to grow my skills, contribute to real products, and learn from experienced teams. When I’m not coding, I stay disciplined in workouts and leveling up my craft every day — consistency is my edge.<br><br>Let’s build something meaningful together.
